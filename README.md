# MILLSBERRY REWRITE

Hi! I'm currently working on re-writing Millsberry.com using NodeJS & PUG.  

I am looking for collaborators on this project that can assist with UI design, various NodeJS functions, and anything in between.  

This is a huge task as the site used flash player, which is not depreciated. I have a few ideas on how to get around it, but in the meantime re-writing the main site is my goal.  

Please feel free to contact me here, or on Discord: TylerLasagna#2512  

Once a little more is done, I will deploy to Heroku for a more 'public' view of it.  

Thanks for viewing!
