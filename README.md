# Millsberry-JS
Millsberry rewritten in ElectronJS (looking for collaborators!)
Currently rewritting the popular children's online game Millsberry using Electron, a Javascript Framework. If you are knowledgable in JS, databases, or HTML please email/message me!  
I'm looking for help to make this project a reality. This project will not properly build with the files that are here. Please contact me if you're interested in testing / contributing to the project.

# UPDATE 2/11/2021  
I'm currently working to rewrite what's been done so far. My data transfer methods are horrible and I'm going to optimize the POST requests with Express and utilize the PUG engine to handle most of the page rendering. I'll work on deploying the work done thus far on Heroku for those who want to see.
