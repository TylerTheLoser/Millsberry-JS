# Millsberry-JS
Millsberry rewritten in ElectronJS (looking for collaborators!)
Currently rewritting the popular children's online game Millsberry using Electron, a Javascript Framework. If you are knowledgable in JS, databases, or HTML please email/message me!  
I'm looking for help to make this project a reality. This project will not properly build with the files that are here. Please contact me if you're interested in testing / contributing to the project.
